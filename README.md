# Project Skyline Â· Safe and Intelligent Autonomy for Aerial Delivery
Santa Clara University Â· Burak KÃ¼rkÃ§Ã¼ Research Group

> A research initiative developing verifiable, safety-critical autonomy for small UAVs operating in human environments.

---

## Overview
Project Skyline develops safety-critical autonomy frameworks for aerial delivery systems. Our work integrates control theory, perception, and simulation-based validation to improve UAV reliability in real-world conditions.

We focus on verifiable, failure-resilient autopilot and perception modules for GPS-denied and disturbance-rich environments such as university campuses, industrial sites, and suburban corridors.

## Research Focus
- **Autopilot Safety and Certification Readiness** â€“ redundant control architectures and verified safety guarantees.  
- **Obstacle Detection and Sensor Fusion** â€“ robust perception under uncertain sensing conditions.  
- **Simulation-Based Validation** â€“ Monte Carlo trials for wind, mass, and sensor fault modeling.  
- **Operational Risk Modeling** â€“ quantitative risk estimation and envelope analysis.

## Example Modules (coming soon, here for placeholder)
- `/matlab/autopilot_validation.m` â€” Monte Carlo flight envelope analysis  
- `/gazebo/sensor_fault_tests/` â€” randomized LiDAR and IMU fault injection

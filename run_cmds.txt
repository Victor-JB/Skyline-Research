Note dependencies:
1. Need UAV drone delivery
2. also need Aerospace Blockset to do cool airplane math

3D simulation engine executable failed to start. Address the issue described in the dialog box.

Before running photorealistic simulation setting, need to install Unreal Engine compatible with Simulink
Unfortunately from my research, only available / primarily supported on windows
